# Emotion Detection using Random Forest

This project aims in finding the emotion of the input text and it finds its application in many real time cases.

Here we have used Random forest algorithm to classify the emotion.


## Installation

Install following library for smooth run

```bash
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```
